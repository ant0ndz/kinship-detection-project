# kinship-detection-project
This project was developed as part of a university "Data Mining in Large Databases" course.

The goal of this project was to train Siamese networks for kinship classification using face images. The Families in the Wild dataset was used to evaluate different architectures for determining familial relationships based on facial similarity.
