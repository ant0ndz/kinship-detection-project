# kinship-detection-project
This project was made as part of a "Data mining in large databases" course in the university.
As part of this project, the dataset "Families in the Wild" was used to train different Siamese networks to perform kinship classification between people using face images.
This repository contains the final report submited, showing the results.
Additionally, the code files created and used to produce results is found under the code directory with the following files:
  * kinship_image_data_class.py - Code created to process the image dataset and allow using it for model training purposes.
  * main code.ipynb - Contains the code for creating the architectures used as well as the training and testing code.
  * EDA and Results.ipynb - Contains code responsible for plots seen in the report which allow EDA and results evaluation.
